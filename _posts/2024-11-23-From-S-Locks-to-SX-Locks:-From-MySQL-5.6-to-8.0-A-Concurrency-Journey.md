## 1. Introduction {#introduction}

MySQL's evolution from version 5.6 to 8.0 represents one of the most significant improvements in database concurrency control. This journey showcases how subtle changes in locking mechanisms can dramatically improve performance and scalability.

## 2. Understanding B+ Trees {#understanding-b-trees}

### Basic Structure
B+ trees are the fundamental data structure used in most modern database systems for indexing. Unlike regular B-trees, B+ trees store all actual data in the leaf nodes, with internal nodes serving purely as a navigation structure.

The core characteristics of B+ trees in MySQL include:
- All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring balanced tree structure
- Leaf nodes contain the actual data or pointers to the data
- Internal nodes contain only keys used for navigation
- Nodes are typically the size of a database page (16KB in MySQL by default)

### Node Types

The B+ tree structure consists of three types of nodes:

1. Root Node
   - The topmost node in the tree
   - Can be both a leaf node (in small trees) or an internal node
   - Minimum of two children unless it's also a leaf node

2. Internal Nodes (Non-leaf Nodes)
   - Contains keys and pointers to child nodes
   - Must be at least half full
   - Used purely for navigation
   - No actual data stored here

3. Leaf Nodes
   - Contains the actual indexed data or references to the data
   - Linked together in a doubly-linked list
   - Allows for efficient range scans
   - Must maintain sorted order

### Insertion and Search Operations

Search operations in a B+ tree follow a path from root to leaf:

```sql
-- Creating a sample table with B-tree index
CREATE TABLE example (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO example VALUES (1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C');

-- This search operation will traverse the B-tree
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = 2;
```

Insert operations are more complex:

```sql
-- This insertion might cause node splits
INSERT INTO example VALUES (1.5, 'Between A and B');

-- Creating an index will build a B-tree
CREATE INDEX idx_data ON example(data);
```

## 3. Locking Mechanisms in Databases {#locking-mechanisms-in-databases}

### Shared Locks (S-Locks)
Shared locks are used for read operations and have the following characteristics:
- Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same resource
- Prevents other transactions from modifying the data
- Does not block other shared locks

```sql
-- Example of acquiring a shared lock (in SQLite syntax)
BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = 1;
-- This implicitly acquires a shared lock
COMMIT;
```

### Exclusive Locks (X-Locks)
Exclusive locks are used for write operations and have these properties:
- Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock
- Blocks both shared and exclusive lock requests
- Required for any modification operation

```sql
-- Example of acquiring an exclusive lock
BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION;
UPDATE example SET data = 'Modified' WHERE id = 1;
-- This implicitly acquires an exclusive lock
COMMIT;
```

### Lock Compatibility Matrix

The following matrix shows lock compatibility:

| Lock Type | Shared (S) | Exclusive (X) | SX |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----|
| Shared (S) | Yes | No | Yes |
| Exclusive (X) | No | No | No |
| SX | Yes | No | No |

## 4. MySQL 5.6 Implementation {#mysql-56-implementation}

### Index-Level Locking

MySQL 5.6 implemented a relatively simple locking strategy:
- The entire index is locked with an S-lock for read operations
- The index receives an X-lock for structural modifications
- This approach simplified implementation but limited concurrency

The process in MySQL 5.6:
```sql
-- Example showing how 5.6 handles index operations
BEGIN;
-- This would acquire an index-level S-lock
SELECT * FROM example WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
COMMIT;

BEGIN;
-- This would acquire an index-level X-lock
INSERT INTO example VALUES (5, 'New Value');
COMMIT;
```

### Page-Level Locking

Page-level locks in 5.6 were simpler:
- Only leaf pages received explicit locks
- Internal nodes were protected by the index-level lock
- Reduced lock management overhead but increased contention

### Limitations and Performance Impact

The main limitations of the 5.6 approach were:
- High contention during structural modifications
- Reader starvation during heavy write workloads
- Limited concurrency during mixed workloads

## 5. MySQL 8.0 Improvements {#mysql-80-improvements}

### Introduction of SX Locks

MySQL 8.0 introduced Schema modification (SX) locks:
- Compatible with shared locks
- Allows reads during structural modifications
- Blocks other structural modifications

```sql
-- Example of operations that would use SX locks in 8.0
BEGIN;
-- This operation might trigger an SX lock
INSERT INTO example VALUES (15, 'Causing Split');
COMMIT;
```

### Non-leaf Page Locking

The 8.0 implementation added explicit locking for non-leaf pages:
- Each internal node can be locked independently
- Reduces contention during tree traversal
- Enables more granular concurrency control

### Latch Coupling

Latch coupling in 8.0 works as follows:
- Child node locks are acquired before releasing parent locks
- Ensures consistent tree traversal
- Reduces the duration of high-level locks

## 6. Practical Examples {#practical-examples}

### Basic Operations

Let's look at some common operations and their locking behavior:

```sql
-- Read operation
SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = 5;

-- Insert operation that doesn't cause splits
INSERT INTO example VALUES (6, 'Simple Insert');

-- Update operation
UPDATE example SET data = 'Modified' WHERE id = 5;
```

### Schema Modification Operations

Operations that modify the tree structure:

```sql
-- Operation causing page split
INSERT INTO example 
SELECT i, 'Value ' || i 
FROM generate_series(1, 1000) i;

-- Creating new index (bulk loading)
CREATE INDEX idx_large ON example(data);
```

## 7. Performance Implications {#performance-implications}

### Read Operations
Read performance characteristics:
- Improved concurrency in 8.0 during structural modifications
- Better handling of hot pages
- More predictable performance under mixed workloads

### Write Operations
Write operation improvements:
- Reduced contention during page splits
- Better handling of concurrent modifications
- More efficient space utilization

### Concurrent Access Patterns
Impact on different access patterns:
- Range scans benefit from reduced lock duration
- Point queries show improved concurrency
- Bulk operations have better throughput
